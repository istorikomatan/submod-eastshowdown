Such commercials can be shown on a variety of TV channels and in a variety of formats to draw as much attention to the idea as possible. In addition, we can use television to organize special programs that will focus on military service and the armed forces in general. These programs can include interviews with military experts and veterans who can talk about their experiences of service and draw attention to contract service.
